Accounting Application
- Income data structure (array or hashmap)
-- addIncome();
--- Price, From, Date, Memo Note
-- removeIncome();
-- totalIncome();
- Expense data structure (array or hashmap)
-- addExpense();
--- Price, To, Date, Memo Note, Check Num
-- removeExpense();
-- totalExpenses();

Haven't gotten so far as I have been extremely busy the past few weeks.
